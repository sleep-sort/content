# A few ideas

Here is an ever-growing list of things either I'd like to or am actively working on. If any of these look interesting, I'd love to pair.Â [Let's connect!](mailto:matthewkoenig@acm.org)

1. ## In-episode AI assistant

A custom model trained on transcripts of existing podcasts for a given show. Then an in-episode interface is built for podcast hosts to recall things that have previously been discussed as well as stats and facts throughout the episode in real time.
2. ## Restaurant seat reservation system

The pitch is simple; what if you could select tables within a restaurant when you make a reservation? There could easily be an up-charge for more desirable seats (more space, near windows, etc.)
3. ## Animal adoption financing platform

There are people who have capital but don't have the ability to care for pets and there are people who have the ability to care for pets but don't have captial for their expenses (i.e. surgeries, medication). This would be basic software to match these two parties.
4. ## Early career pipeline for an AI workforce

I was lucky enough to intern for some incredible firms when I was just starting out. With AI, however, interns realistically won't be able to provide the incremental value they once did. Without intern or vocational programs, how might young professionals gain experience and skills? This platform would aim to solve that problem.
